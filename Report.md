Task 1
====

Task 1 was a task asking me to create a currency converting programme in python that would convert from these four currencies: GBP (£), USD ($), Euro (€) and JPY (¥).

First of all, I had to import the decimal data type. To do this, i used the python code: "Import decimal." This allowed me to be able to use decimals in my converter, this is really useful as some people will want to convert an exact amount. After this, the programme welcomes the user to the programme and asks for a numeric value to be entered. This is the value that the user will be converting later on. After the user has entered a value, the programme asks which currency the value the user just entered is. The options are only the currencies mentioned above. After this, the programme asks which currency the user would like to convert to. Again, the options are only the ones mentioned above. The programme has a block of code that sets the variable name of the currencies to their value compared to the GBP. The GBP is not in the block of code
